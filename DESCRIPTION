Description: Provides a pipeline of tools for analysing circadian 
    time-series data using functional data analysis (FDA). The package 
    supports smoothing of rhythmic time series, functional principal 
    component analysis (FPCA), and extraction of group-level traits from 
    functional representations. Analyses can incorporate multiple curve 
    derivatives and optional temporal segmentation, enabling comparative 
    analysis of circadian dynamics across experimental groups and time 
    windows.
